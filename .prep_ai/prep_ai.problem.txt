Let's discuss function() 
I want to implement the idea of a function and a return value of one of our basic types.
BEFORE you write code ... let's discuss

I see something like this working.

function NameOfFunction(string $parameterOne, integer $ParameterTwo = 1): boolean
{
    boolean $results = true;

    if ($parameterOne == "James") {
        $results = false;
    }

    return $results;
}

We may not be ready for this ... but let's talk BEFORE you try to write code.
