We are going to create a src/helpers/ system

I would like to do this through a configuration syntax
and not really write a lot of code to support this feature

We are going to create the ability for people to create
helpers in the future. The system helpers will come first.

I need a way to defined a helper function ... I am going to start
them all with name- and them follow up with the system extension
that they modify.

left-trim(<string_to_trim>, [<chars_to_trim>])

The chars_to_trim should default to the MCL_TRIM_CHARS_DEFAULT if
not specificied by the user.

Let's make this easy to configure. Thoughtsand discussion before
we write any code.

DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS IN MY CODE!
ONLY GIVE ME FILES THAT HAVE CHANGED!
DO NOT WRITE CODE UNLESS I ASK!
