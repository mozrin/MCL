We are going to create the ability to add functions. Here is what I want ...

in the src/ folder I am going to create a folder called extensions/

I want to add a file called random.cpp and if necessary random.h in that folder and then have the main program read everything in the extensions folder and integrate them into the language.

I like the idea of each file in the extensiosn folder being a function in the language. Sound okay?

DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS IN MY CODE!
ONLY GIVE ME FILES THAT HAVE CHANGED!
