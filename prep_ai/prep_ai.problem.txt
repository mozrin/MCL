I want to define to types and stick with them ...

string = self explanitory
number = anything that is numerical .. stored as a 64 bit value.

the plan is that every other kind of numerical value is a wrapper around number.

integer is a type of number
decimal(x,y) is a type of number where the precision is x to the left and y to the right.
boolean is a 0 or non-zero number (in memory) - the user see true/false

what are your thoughts?
